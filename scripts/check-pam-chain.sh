# End-to-end check that sudo actually reaches our PAM module.
#
# Why this exists: 1.0.2 installed everything correctly on macOS 15 and still fell back
# to the password, because /etc/pam.d/sudo did not include sudo_local, so the module was
# never consulted. Everything "looked" installed. Only asking sudo to run and observing
# whether the module was contacted catches that.
#
# Asserting "sudo succeeded" proves nothing on CI runners, where sudo is passwordless.
# Instead we stand up a fake daemon on the socket the module talks to: if it receives a
# connection, the module ran.
#
# Destructive: installs the module system-wide. CI only.
